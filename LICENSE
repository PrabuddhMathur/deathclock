 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
 GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
 any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
 your programs, too.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

 To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
 certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
 you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
 you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
 rights.

 Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

 Third-party distributors of GPL-covered software also protect your
 rights by ensuring that recipients receive all the rights the
 distributors received.  These distributors must make sure recipients
 receive or can get the source code.  They must also take steps to make
 sure that third parties who receive the software from them also have
 the same rights.

 Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
 software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
 avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
 make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
 patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.

                         GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
    notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that
    refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
    other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the
    Program.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
    that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
       whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
       part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
       parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
       when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
       interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
       announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
       notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
       a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
       these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
       License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
       does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
       the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
       source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
       1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
       to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
       physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-
       readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed
       under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
       used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
       distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed
       only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
       program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
       accord with Subsection b above.)

 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
 code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
 associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
 control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
 special exception, the source code distributed need not include
 anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
 with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
 system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
 accompanies the executable.
